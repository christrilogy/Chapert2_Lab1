          <p>Welcome to WIld Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
            and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a
            nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife. </p>
          <p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We
            also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back into
            their natural environment.</p>
          <p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help charset
            for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a
             sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
